# Task Samurai

Task Samurai is a tool that connects your source code providers and your ticket management systems to provide instant recommendations on what code you need to modify to complete coding tasks.

*Have you ever picked up a ticket that requires modifying a component in your team's code that you're not very familiar with? Did you end up spending way too much time going through other people's code just to find that 2 line change you needed to complete your ticket?*

*Do you spend too much of your time explaining code to other members of your team because they're not yet familiar with all of the code you've worked on?*
